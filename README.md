# ðŸ“§ Spam Detection using Machine Learning

This repository contains a simple implementation of a spam message detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models. The entire workflow is presented in a Jupyter Notebook.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify SMS messages as **spam** or **ham** (non-spam) based on their content. It includes data preprocessing, feature extraction using text vectorization techniques, and training classification models.

---

## ðŸ§° Technologies & Libraries

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK or other NLP libraries (if used)

## ðŸ§ª Workflow

1. **Data Loading** â€“ Import and inspect the dataset (SMS messages with spam/ham labels).
2. **Text Preprocessing** â€“ Clean and normalize text (remove punctuation, lowercase, etc.).
3. **Vectorization** â€“ Convert text into numerical features (e.g., using CountVectorizer or TF-IDF).
4. **Model Training** â€“ Train machine learning classifiers (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression).
5. **Evaluation** â€“ Evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
